To recreate this project, please:

- Update the config.php file to your own database settings.

- Set up a database.

- To create and populate the database tables:
   Copy and paste code from setup.sql and 
   then in browser run /resourcing/sql/user_password.php 
   (eg copy and paste http://localhost:81/resourcing/sql/user_password.php into browser updating the path as required)

If having difficulties with the <script> elements, may have to do 
alt + enter to download the libraries
   
As the 'uploads' directory was empty when the last push was done to github, it is not appearing in the repository.  If doing a pull, will also need to set up an 'uploads' directory.
