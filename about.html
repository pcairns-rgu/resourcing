<h3>Purpose</h3>
   <p> A task management resourcing tool to allocate work across tutors and support business continuity.</p>
   <h3>Why Required?</h3>
    <h4>Tutors</h4>
    <p>Tutors lecture on a portfolio of modules and the workflow for each module differs across a semester often resulting in task deadlines across their portfolio clashing.
    Currently each tutor keeps their to-do list either on a spreadsheet, a piece of paper, or in their heads.</p>
    <h4>Head of school</h4>
    <p>The head of school requires oversight of the workload across the school to aid
        with allocation of work and understand future staffing requirements.</p>
    <h4>Why Change?</h4>
   <p>The adoption of a centralised task management system which stores tutor’s to-do lists:
    1.	Provides real-time knowledge on the workload of tutors and the School to understand any current bottlenecks
    2.	Allows prediction of future workloads to allow staffing requirements to be proactively assessed
    3.	Provides business continuity as should a tutor be absent or leave RGU, the incumbent knows the current task status and pending deadlines.
   </p>
    <h4>How does <span class="forecast">FORECAST </span>help?</h4>
    <p>FORECAST provides separate views for:</p>
        <ul>
    <li>
        The Head of School – can view individual tutor or group of tutors to-do lists to understand current workload.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each module - shows the tasks allocated to the module tutors along with a repository of uploaded files relevant to the module to encourage knowledge sharing.
    </li>
        <li>
        Each tutor - shows their individual to-do list.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The tasks for a to-do list can be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
    set up as new and allocated to a tutor,
        </li>
        <li>
    amended,
        </li>
        <li>
    reallocated to another tutor, and
        </li>
        <li>
    removed from the list.
        </li>
    </ul>
